# essential-virus
Silly funny Windows executable program made in C++ that creates a file with the 7 words: E S E N C I A meme. The virus thing is because if you dont answer a correct number even though been requested multiple times, the program will start increasing the size of the file till it crashes the pc.

P.D. The only file needed to run the code is the ESENCIA.exe in bin\Debug which already has been statically compiled (has the requiered libraries in it). Also the "virus" file will be created in the place the .exe is, if not moved it will appear in bin\Debug. At last, the current file named E_S_E_N_C_I_A.txt in the commit is an example of what the code does when answer properly (without the virus happening).
