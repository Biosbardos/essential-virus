# ü¶† essential-virus

**essential-virus** is a playful Windows executable program written in C++. Inspired by Dragon Ball memes and classic prank software, it is designed purely for entertainment and educational purposes. While it is not intended to harm your PC, failure to follow the instructions may lead to unintended consequences.

## üéâ What Does It Do?

- When executed, the program:
  - Prompts the user for a number.
  - It creates a file containing the seven words: `E S E N C I A` the number of times given by the user and also draws and ASCII art of Broly.
  - It displays in the terminal the same that it is in the file so you dont have to go open the file to see it (it doesn't saw the Broly).
  - If answered incorrectly, then the "virus" part comes and starts increasing the file sizes by printing `E S E N C I A`.

  *(Have to say that your asked multiple times to stop trolling and input a correct value before the virus comes to play and you can always close the terminal or shut down the pc. DON'T TRY TO DELETE THE FILE, Windows won't let you since it is open and been use)*
